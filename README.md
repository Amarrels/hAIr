## 🧬 What to Know About Different Hair Types

The **shape of the hair follicle** determines the structure of the hair shaft and its growth pattern, ultimately affecting texture and curl pattern:

- A **round follicle** produces straight hair  
- An **oval-shaped follicle** results in wavy hair  
- A **curved or hooked follicle** leads to curly or coily hair  

**Hair follicle density** also plays a major role:  
- Higher density → thicker, coarser hair  
- Lower density → finer, thinner hair

## 📊 Hair Type Categories

### 1. Straight Hair  
Naturally straight, shiny, and smooth. It’s typically resilient to damage and easy to maintain.

### 2. Wavy Hair  
Features an S-shaped pattern. Voluminous but prone to frizz without proper moisture.

### 3. Curly Hair  
Coiled or spiral-shaped strands that can range from loose curls to tight ringlets. Often prone to dryness and frizz.

### 4. Coily Hair  
Tightly coiled strands in a zigzag pattern. Usually fragile and dense, requiring deep moisture and gentle care.

### Curly Hair  
- **3a:** Loose, soft curls  
- **3b:** Springy, defined curls  
- **3c:** Tight corkscrew curls, prone to shrinkage  

### Coily Hair  
- **4a:** Tightly coiled, defined spirals  
- **4b:** Z-shaped coils, less defined  
- **4c:** Minimal visible curl pattern, extremely fragile

## ⚠️ Issues in Hair Care

Hair greatly influences identity, self-esteem, and confidence. But finding the right product is often a costly, frustrating guessing game due to:

- Hair type & subcategory  
- Follicle density  
- Damage level  
- Environmental & climate factors  

The **U.S. hair care industry** earns **$13.44 billion annually**, growing at **1.17% yearly**.  

The result: wasted money, product buildup, and inconsistent results.  
The question: **How do we eliminate the guesswork?**
